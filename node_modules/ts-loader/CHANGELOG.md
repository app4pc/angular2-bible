## v0.6.1

- Improve initial build performance significantly for larger projects (#100)
- Fix issue with nightly (#96)

## v0.6.0

## v0.5.3

- Utilize TypeScript's new custom module resolution logic to integrate with webpack. This essentially
  means that TypeScript will resolve files exactly the same as webpack does (supporting aliases, etc).
  See the [aliasResolution test](test/aliasResolution) for an example. Only supported in TS 1.6 and
  above.
- Rework error reporting to resolve certain edge cases with dependencies. In general errors should
  be much more consistent now in watch mode.
- Fix issue with targeting ES6 and transpile mode (#36)

## v0.5.2

## v0.5.1

  - Suggest how to install TypeScript if it hasn't been installed
  - Show TypeScript version when compiling
  - Warn if TypeScript version is incompatible

## v0.5.0

- Add support for `transpileOnly` loader option. See README for more information.
- TypeScript is no longer a dependency of the loader and must be installed separately
- Loader options can now be set as a property in `webpack.config.js`
- TypeScript options can be set through the loader option `compilerOptions`
- Improved error reporting
  - Errors from all files in the TypeScript application are now reported in watch mode instead of 
    from just those files that changed. This means that making a breaking change in a dependency
    will now be correctly reported as an error in the dependent file.
  - Errors with TypeScript options are now reported as webpack errors instead of logged to console
  - Error output no longer contains the filename once from webpack and again in the error message.
    Instead, the filename is only reported by webpack
  - Fixed issue with latest version of webpack where filenames could be reported twice for the same
    error in certain situations
- Using the `declaration` TypeScript option no longer results in errors
- Add support for the `newLine` TypeScript option
- Tests have been revamped to be full integration tests with nightly builds against the current stable
  and nightly TypeScript. Many new tests have been added.
